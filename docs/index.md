# Mirra

**Mirror-test your tagless final algebras in Scala.**

Mirra verifies that a real repository implementation behaves the same way as a simple in-memory model — using property-based testing to catch the bugs you'd never think to write a case for.

> **Status:** This project is not active and was a proof-of-concept. It may still be useful as a reference or starting point.

## The problem: duplicated expectations

When you property-test a repository directly, you end up re-implementing its logic in your assertions. Suppose you're testing a `deleteWhenOlderThen` method. Your property test generates random persons and a random age threshold, calls the repository, and then you need to assert the right people were deleted. To do that, you filter the generated input list yourself:

```scala
prop { (persons: List[Person], age: Int) =>
  repo.insertMany(persons)
  repo.deleteWhenOlderThen(age)
  val remaining = repo.listAll()

  // Re-implementing the repository's filter logic right here in the test
  remaining must_== persons.filter(_.age <= age)
}
```

This is fragile. Your assertion duplicates the exact filtering logic the repository is supposed to implement. If you get the assertion wrong (off-by-one, wrong comparison operator, edge case), the test is worthless — and you won't know it. You've encoded your expectations twice: once in the implementation, once in the test, and you're hoping they match.

## The solution: make the expectations an executable model

Instead of scattering filtering logic across assertions, **move it into a proper in-memory implementation** of the same algebra. This model is trivially simple — just list operations on a case class — so it's easy to get right. Then run the same operations against both the real implementation and the model, and compare results.

This is the [test oracle](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/property-based-testing-2/#test-oracle) pattern: you don't assert _what_ the result should be, you assert that two implementations _agree_.

The expectations now live in one place (the model), they're a real runnable implementation rather than ad-hoc assertions, and every property test is just: "does the real thing do the same as the model?"

```
  Generate random data
            │
    ┌───────┴───────┐
    ▼               ▼
 ┌──────┐     ┌──────────┐
 │ Real │     │ In-memory│
 │ impl │     │  model   │
 │(DB)  │     │ (Mirra)  │
 └──┬───┘     └────┬─────┘
    │              │
    ▼              ▼
  result₁ ═══ result₂ ?
```

If they diverge, either the real implementation has a bug, or the model is wrong — both of which are valuable to discover.

### Why this also helps your service tests

Once you've proven the in-memory model is faithful to the real implementation, you can use that model as a drop-in replacement in your service-layer unit tests. No database, no containers, no network — just fast, deterministic tests that you _know_ are behaviorally accurate, because the model has been validated against the real thing.

This is much better than mocks: a mock returns whatever you tell it to, even outputs the real implementation would never produce for a given input. A validated in-memory model can't lie that way.

## How it works

1. **Define** a tagless final algebra for your repository.
2. **Implement** it for real — against a database, HTTP API, etc.
3. **Model** it with `Mirra[S, *]`, a specialized `State` monad with built-in CRUD helpers (`insertMany`, `delete`, `all`, etc.) that operate over a simple in-memory state `S` using Monocle lenses.
4. **Wire** both into a `SystemUnderTest`, which uses `SemigroupalK` (from cats-tagless) to run the same program against both interpreters simultaneously.
5. **Assert mirroring** — for any randomly generated input, both must produce the same result.

### What properties fall out of this?

| Property | What it catches |
|---|---|
| **Data loss** | Insert → read doesn't return everything that was inserted |
| **Locality** | A delete/update affects records it shouldn't (or misses ones it should) |
| **Idempotency** | Applying an operation twice changes the result vs. applying it once |

You don't need to encode these properties manually. They emerge naturally from mirroring: if the real implementation drops a record, reorders something, or over-deletes, the model will disagree.

## Key concepts

**`Mirra[S, A]`** — A `State`-like monad with built-in helpers for modeling CRUD operations (`insertMany`, `delete`, `all`, `unit`, etc.). Uses Monocle lenses to target collections within your state type `S`. This is where your expected behavior lives — in one place, as a real implementation, not scattered across test assertions.

**`SystemUnderTest`** — Wires together a real implementation and a model using `SemigroupalK` to run both through the same algebra simultaneously. Accepts a natural transformation `TransactionEffect ~> F` (or `~> Task` for ZIO) that interprets real database actions.

**`assertMirroring`** — Executes the program against both interpreters, diffs the results, and fails the test if they diverge.

**`MirraSuite[F[_], Alg[_[_]]]`** — A munit trait providing `assertMirroring`. Extends `CatsEffectSuite` and `ScalaCheckEffectSuite`; mix it into your test suite and implement `bootstrapSystemUnderTest`.

**`MirraZIOSuite[Alg[_[_]]]`** — A ZIO Test equivalent of `MirraSuite`. Extends `ZIOSpecDefault`; the effect type is fixed to `Task`. Property inputs come from ZIO Test's built-in `Gen`; resource management uses `ZLayer` + `provideShared`.

**`FunctorK` / `SemigroupalK`** — Type classes from [cats-tagless](https://github.com/typelevel/cats-tagless) that allow transforming the effect type of an algebra. Derived automatically with `Derive.functorK` / `Derive.semigroupalK`.

## Inspiration

This library implements the [test oracle](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/property-based-testing-2/#test-oracle) pattern described by Scott Wlaschin, applied to tagless final algebras: maintain a simplified model alongside the system under test, apply the same operations to both, and compare final states.
